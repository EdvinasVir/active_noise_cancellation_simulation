# active_noise_cancellation_simulation_GNU_Octave
An active noise cancellation simulation using feedback filtered-x least mean squares algorithm on GNU Octave. This was created as a part of my bachelor degree project. Hope this code helps to better understand feedforward active noise cancellation algorithms. Code tested on GNU Octave, but should work on MATLAB with some minor tweaks.
